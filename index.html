      <h2><li> Creating links between pages</li></h2>
     <h3> Links are the defining feature of the web
        because they allow you to move from
        one web page to another — enabling the
        very idea of browsing or surfing.
        You will commonly come across the following types of links:
        ● Links from one website to another
        ● Links from one page to another on the same website
        ● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
        same page
        ● Links that open in a new browser window
        ● Links that start up your email program and address a new
        email to someone</h3> 
        <h2><li>Writing Links</li></h2>
        <h3>Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
            between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
            which page you want to link to using the href attribute.Writing Links
            This is the page the
            link takes you to
            
            Opening link tag
            
            This is the text the
            user clicks on
            
            Closing
            link tag
            <li>The text between the opening
                <a> tag and closing </a> tag
                is known as link text. Where
                possible, your link text should
                explain where visitors will be
                taken if they click on it (rather
                than just saying "click here").
                Below you can see the link to
                IMDB that was created on the
                previous page.</li>
                <li>Many people navigate websites
                    by scanning the text for links.
                    Clear link text can help visitors
                    find what they want. This
                    will give them a more positive
                    impression of your site and may
                    encourage them to visit it for
                    longer. (It also helps people
                    using screen reader software.)</li>
                    <li>To write good link text, you can
                        think of words people might
                        use when searching for the
                        page that you are linking to.
                        (For example, rather than write
                        "places to stay" you could use
                        something more specific such as
                        "hotels in New York.")</li>
        </h3>
        <h2><li>Linking to Other Sites</li></h2>
        <h3>Links are created using the <a>
            element which has an attribute
            called href. The value of the
            href attribute is the page that
            you want people to go to when
            they click on the link.
            Users can click on anything that
            appears between the opening
            <a> tag and the closing </a>
            tag and will be taken to the page
            specified in the href attribute.
            When you link to a different
            website, the value of the href
            attribute will be the full web
            address for the site, which is
            known as an absolute URL.
            Browsers show links in blue with
            an underline by default.</h3>
            <h2><li>Email link</li></h2>
            <h3>To create a link that starts up
                the user's email program and
                addresses an email to a specified
                email address, you use the <a>
                element. However, this time the
                value of the href attribute starts
                with mailto: and is followed by
                the email address you want the
                email to be sent to.
                On the right you can see that
                an email link looks just like any
                other link but, when it is clicked
                on, the user's email program
                will open a new email message
                and address it to the person
                specified in the link.</h3>
