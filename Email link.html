<h2><li>Email link</li></h2>
            <h3>To create a link that starts up
                the user's email program and
                addresses an email to a specified
                email address, you use the <a>
                element. However, this time the
                value of the href attribute starts
                with mailto: and is followed by
                the email address you want the
                email to be sent to.
                On the right you can see that
                an email link looks just like any
                other link but, when it is clicked
                on, the user's email program
                will open a new email message
                and address it to the person
                specified in the link.
                <a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>
            </h3>
