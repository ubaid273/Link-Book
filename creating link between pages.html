 <h2><li> Creating links between pages</li></h2>
   <h3> Links are the defining feature of the web
      because they allow you to move from
      one web page to another — enabling the
      very idea of browsing or surfing.
      You will commonly come across the following types of links:
      ● Links from one website to another
      ● Links from one page to another on the same website
      ● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
      same page
      ● Links that open in a new browser window
      ● Links that start up your email program and address a new
      email to someone</h3>
